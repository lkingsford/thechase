Once upon a time, there was a young man 
named Jack who happened upon the
"Happy Cult of the Bentatacled Nothings". 

He joined because he liked black eye make 
up, and thought it would be a cool way to
pick up chicks.

Until one night, it was very real.

Deep in the forest, Jack screamed at the
BLACK that he had summoned.
