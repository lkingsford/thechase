def get_route(game_map, start, dest):
    # Performs an A* search to find route to go somewhere
    # Input:
    #   x, y - from self.x and self.y
    #   self.currentMap.Walkable(x,y) - returns if can walk at x,y
    #   dest - (x, y) tuplet of destination
    #
    # Returns a list of (x, y) tuplets
    #
    # This does have a special behaviour that it will list the final square whether or not it can be 
    # walked on - so, it will attack if needed when position is fed to TryMove
    # 
    # From <http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm>
    # 1) Add the starting square (or node) to the open list.
    # 2) Repeat the following:
    #   a) Look for the lowest F cost square on the open list. We refer to this as the current square.
    #   b) Switch it to the closed list.
    #   c) For each of the 8 squares adjacent to this current square 
    #      If it is not walkable or if it is on the closed list, ignore it. Otherwise do the following.           
    #      If it isn't on the open list, add it to the open list. Make the current square the parent of this square. Record the F, G, and H costs of the square. 
    #      If it is on the open list already, check to see if this path to that square is better, using G cost as the measure. A lower G cost means that this is a better path. If so, change the parent of the square to the current square, and recalculate the G and F scores of the square. If you are keeping your open list sorted by F score, you may need to resort the list to account for the change.
    #   d) Stop when you:
    #      Add the target square to the closed list, in which case the path has been found (see note below), or
    #      Fail to find the target square, and the open list is empty. In this case, there is no path.   
    # 3) Save the path. Working backwards from the target square, go from each square to its parent square until you reach the starting square. That is your path.
